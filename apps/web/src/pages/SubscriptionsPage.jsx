/**
 * Shipped subscription home page.
 *
 * Mounts the shipped <SubscriptionAccountSection /> which handles three views:
 * (1) active-subscription view (plan title + status pill + Manage portal button),
 * (2) no-subscription view (copy + "View plans" CTA), and
 * (3) post-checkout polling state when the URL carries `?just_subscribed=1`
 *     — the section detects the flag and polls until the new sub activates.
 *
 * The page itself is intentionally narrow-scope — it does not carry profile /
 * avatar / password-change UX; those belong on a separate /profile or /account
 * page if the site needs them.
 *
 * Mount on App.jsx as a PROTECTED route at /subscriptions (auth-gated via
 * ProtectedRoute — anonymous visitors should not reach this page):
 *   import SubscriptionsPage from '@/pages/SubscriptionsPage.jsx';
 *   <Route path="/subscriptions" element={<ProtectedRoute><SubscriptionsPage /></ProtectedRoute>} />
 *
 * The path /subscriptions is CONTRACTUAL with the shipped SubscribeButton —
 * its successUrl/cancelUrl both build `window.location.origin + MANAGE_PATH +
 * '?just_subscribed=1'`. Renaming the route leaves just-paid users on a 404.
 *
 * Authenticated nav (header / user menu / mobile menu) MUST include a link
 * to /subscriptions so the user can reach the manage portal at any time.
 *
 * Agents may restyle hero copy / layout / surrounding sections freely.
 * PRESERVE the <SubscriptionAccountSection /> mount — recreating its
 * UX inline duplicates the auth gate, subscription lookup, and manage
 * portal logic that already live in the shipped component.
